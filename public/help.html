            Welcome, and thank you for agreeing to evaluate this demo of our novel new ECG interpretation solution. ECG Teach & Test is a next-generation learning solution that creates a personalized “one-on-one“ learning experience based on your knowledge, your needs. the way you like to learn, and the rate at which you learn. It’s also challenging, immersive, and highly interactive — keeping you interested and engaged.
            <br><br>ECG Teach & Test allows you easy access to quick summaries and in-depth reviews; video- and text-based learning, side-by-side comparisons of arrhythmias, and more.
            <br><br>Importantly. as the name implies and you will see, this program focuses on knowledge-through-testing (“learning by doing”): Knowledge acquisition by repetitive testing of key concepts in a variety of different testing formats — until you truly understand and retain the information and skill before moving on.
            <br><br>In addition, you will be able to save any tip, note, or quiz question as a PDF or flashcard, then access it in your “Personal Digital Vault” for review at a later time, allowing you to create your own “Teach & Test” guide.
            </p>

            This demo focuses on atrial fibrillation. To begin, tap on the get-started button at the bottom, or tap on any category in the top and bottom navigation bars. The demo will cycle through a representative example of the content.

                <br><br>When you reach a green bar at the end of a page that says “End of example. Please choose another category,” this means the sample content for that category is finished. Some categories will show a simple example without going into greater detail or showing you the associated quiz. Others, such as “Compare & Contrast“ and “Arrhythmias In-Depth” will provide a more robust experience.
                <br><br>Take it for a spin and return to a category as often as you like.
                <br><br>Thanks again for your time and feedback.
                <br><br>Buckle up and enjoy the ride!<br><br>
